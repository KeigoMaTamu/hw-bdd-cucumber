Feature: display list of movies filtered by MPAA rating
  As a concerned parent

  Background: movies have been added to database # features/filter_movie_list.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist:            # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:4
      | title                   | rating | release_date |
      | Aladdin                 | G      | 25-Nov-1992  |
      | The Terminator          | R      | 26-Oct-1984  |

    Then 10 seed movies should exist             # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:16

  Scenario: restrict to movies with 'PG' or 'R' ratings # features/filter_movie_list.feature:25
    When I check the following ratings: PG,R            # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:35

DEPRECATION: Using `should` from rspec-expectations' old `:should` syntax without explicitly enabling the syntax is deprecated. Use the new `:expect` syntax or explicitly enable `:should` with `config.expect_with(:rspec) { |c| c.syntax = :should }` instead. Called from /home/ec2-user/environment/hw-bdd-cucumber/rottenpotatoes/features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:233:in `block in <top (required)>'.
